- **Market basket patterns** for recommendation engine

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Backend Architecture

- **Flask API** with CORS enabled
- **Apriori Algorithm** for market basket analysis (mlxtend)
- **Multiple ML Models** for sales forecasting (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- **Synthetic Data Generator** with realistic product relationships
- **RESTful Endpoints** for all AI operations

### Frontend Architecture

- **React** with Vite build system
- **Centralized API Service** for backend communication
- **Real-time Data Loading** with error handling
- **Responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS and Lucide icons
- **Chart Visualization** with Recharts library

## ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS

1. **Test All Features**: Visit each page and test functionality
2. **Upload Real Data**: Use your own retail transaction data
3. **Customize Models**: Adjust AI parameters for your business needs
4. **Production Deployment**: Configure for production environment

## ðŸ“‹ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Frontend Shows Errors:

- Check browser console for API connection issues
- Verify backend is running on http://localhost:5000
- Refresh page to reload components

### If Backend Returns Errors:

- Check terminal output for Python errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify training data was uploaded successfully

### If No Recommendations Appear:

- Upload more diverse transaction data
- Check that products exist in the training dataset
- Lower minimum support threshold in Apriori algorithm
